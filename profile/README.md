2024 World Figure Skating Championships Skaters, Predictions

Japan has three of the four defending figure skating World Champions, with Shoma Ono, Kaori Sakamoto, and Riku Miura and Ryuichi Kihara as defending Men‚Äôs, Women‚Äôs and Pairs World Champs respectively. Americans Madison Chock and Evan Bates are the defending champions in Ice Dance.

All of the above athletes are back for this year‚Äôs World Championships and are predicted to once again top the podium. Other contenders include in the men‚Äôs event include Japan‚Äôs Yuma Kagiyama (the 2022 Olympic silver medalist); two-time U.S. Champ Ilia Malinin (a.k.a. the ‚ÄúQuad God‚Äù); and 2024 European Champion Adam Siao Him Fa, from France.

On the women‚Äôs side, defending champ Sakamoto will be challenged by European Champ Loena Hendrickx, and Japanese teammate Hana Yoshida, who recently became just the 19th woman to successfully land a triple axel in competition. Newly-crowned U.S. women‚Äôs champ Amber Glenn could also land on the podium.

The pairs competition looks like a showdown between Japan, Canada and Italy, with Miura/Kihara; the Canadian veterans Deanna Stellato-Dudek and Maxime Deschamps; and reigning bronze medalists Sara Conti and Niccol√≤ Macii from Italy.

And the ice dance podium will also likely be a three-country affair, with Chock and Bates from the U.S.; Piper Gilles and Paul Poirier from Canada; and Charl√®ne Guignard and Marco Fabbri from Italy all fighting for the gold medal.
